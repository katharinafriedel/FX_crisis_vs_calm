# FX_crisis_vs_calm
This project analyzes how major FX currency pairs behave during periods of financial stress compared to stable times. The focus is on changes in correlation and volatility patterns, with statistical testing and visualizations to identify regime shifts in the FX market.

The objective of this project is to assess how correlations between FX pairs shift in crises, whether volatility increases significantly under financial stress, and what the implications are for risk, diversification, and portfolio management.
